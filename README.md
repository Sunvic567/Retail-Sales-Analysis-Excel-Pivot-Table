🛒 Retail Sales Analysis – Excel Pivot Table
📌 Project Overview

This project explores a Retail Sales Dataset using Excel Pivot Tables. The goal is to analyze customer purchasing patterns across demographics and product categories, providing business insights that can support decision-making.

The dataset contains transaction-level details such as:

Transaction ID

Date

Customer ID

Gender

Age

Product Category

Quantity

Price per Unit

Total Amount

📊 Pivot Table Analysis

I created a pivot table to analyze the sum of quantities purchased, broken down by:

Rows: Customer Gender (Male, Female)

Columns: Product Categories (Beauty, Clothing, Electronics)

Values: Sum of Quantity

Grand Totals: For both rows and columns

✅ Key Insights

Gender-based Purchasing Behavior

Female customers purchased slightly more items overall compared to male customers.

Both genders showed strong interest across all categories, with Clothing being slightly higher in demand.

Category Trends

Clothing had the highest overall purchases.

Electronics showed balanced purchases across genders.

Beauty products were also popular among both genders.

Grand Totals

Total Quantity Purchased: 2,514 units across all categories.

🔍 Opportunities for Further Analysis

To expand this project, additional pivot tables could include:

Total Sales Value (Revenue) instead of just quantities.

Age Group Analysis (e.g., 18–25, 26–35, 36–45, 46+) to identify key demographics.

Time Trends (Monthly/Quarterly sales) to detect seasonality.

Average Spending per Transaction by gender or age group.
